1.	DATA COLLECTION
We collect personal and non-personal information to provide you with the best possible experience on the platform. The types of information we collect include:
Personal Information
Personal information is any data that identifies or can be used to identify you directly or indirectly. This may include:
Your name, email address, phone number, and account details when you register on the Platform.
If you register on our Platform using Google Single Sign-On (SSO), we will automatically receive your Google account email address. This email will be used both for account creation and for enrollment in our communications list, including our weekly newsletter and updates. You can opt out of non-essential communications at any time.
Professional or financial details, such as trading experience or prop firm preferences, if provided during your use of the Platform.
Any information you voluntarily share with us, such as when you contact us or participate in surveys.
Non-Personal Information
Non-personal information is collected automatically and does not directly identify you. This may include:
Device and browser details (e.g., type, version, and operating system).
IP address and geolocation data (where permissible by law).
Website usage data, including pages visited, time spent, and clickstream patterns.
Analytics and Session Recording
We may use analytics and session-recording tools to understand how users interact with the Platform and to improve our product, diagnose technical issues, and detect fraud. These tools may collect information about your interactions with the Platform, including page and screen views, clicks, mouse movements, navigation paths, timestamps, console logs, events (feature usage), and device and browser details (type, version, operating system, screen size). When you are logged in, session recordings may be associated with your account identifier to help troubleshoot account-specific issues.
We do not intentionally collect payment card numbers, full passwords, or other highly sensitive authentication data. We will only enable session recording for users in jurisdictions that require explicit consent after the user has provided affirmative, documented consent. For users who opt out, we will not record session replays or set related tracking cookies.
Cookies and Similar Technologies
We may use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your browsing experience. These technologies may collect information about your interactions with our website, such as your preferences and session details.
Consent for Session Recording and Analytics
Where required by law (including for users in the European Economic Area and the UK), we will obtain your explicit opt-in consent before enabling session recording or analytics that may capture page content. You may change or withdraw consent at any time via the cookie settings, your account settings, or by contacting privacy@fundedforyou.com. Consent decisions are recorded with timestamps to demonstrate compliance.
Third-Party Sources
We may also receive information about you from third-party sources, such as:
Social media platforms if you engage with us there.
Referral or advertising partners when you access our Platform through their links.
We ensure that any data collected is handled in compliance with applicable data protection laws.
